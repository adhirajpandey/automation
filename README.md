# Automation [![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6.1-brightgreen.svg?)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Collection of my automated tasks.

> **Disclaimer**: Some of the scripts are small and may not be very useful such as [Open-essentials](https://github.com/endormi/automation/blob/master/open-essentials/essentials.py) and [Send-email](https://github.com/endormi/automation/blob/master/send-email/email.py), but are still pretty cool :).

> You might be wondering why I decided to keep [Expenses](https://github.com/endormi/automation/blob/master/expenses/expense.py) and [Income](https://github.com/endormi/automation/blob/master/income/income.py) separate, it's just my personal preference.

Install requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
